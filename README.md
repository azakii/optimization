# Task at AutomatedPros (using webpack)

This is a simple project that uses Webpack to bundle your JavaScript and other assets. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Build

1. Run the following command to build the project:

   ```bash
     npm run build
   ```

   This will generate the bundled files in the dist directory.

## Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server, and you can view the project in your browser at http://localhost:9000
